package main

// Ihis file facilitates unit tests, but does not run any tests itself.
// It includes difficulty settings for distributed tests and assert statements.
// This program runs generate_unit_tests.go when you type "go generate" because of the following magic comment:
//go:generate go run generate_unit_tests.go

// Other than that, it does nothing.
