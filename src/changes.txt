Added Raft integration and rearranged packages.

Filled out clerk.go, fs_server.go, and ops.go with my code from lab 3. 
Split ad/assertDebug.go into assert.go and debug.go.
Moved code generation into new package "main". Generate code by running "go generate" in src/main/.
Created new package "filesystem" for the interface and supporting files because they are not
specific to fsraft.
Removed legacy package "tree".
Removed difficulty OneServer because a Raft instance with no peers doesn't work.
